                    <h2>Background</h2>

                    <p>"Mental health is important at every stage of life and it includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being.  As people age, they may experience certain life changes that impact their mental health, such as coping with a serious illness or losing a loved one. Although many people will adjust to these life changes, some may experience feelings of grief, social isolation, or loneliness. When these feelings persist, they can lead to mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety.  Effective treatment options are available to help older adults and people at every stage of life to manage their mental health and improve their quality of life. Recognizing the signs and seeing a health care provider are the first steps to getting treatment." <br><br>(Source: CDC, Division of Population Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, June 29, 2023)</p>
